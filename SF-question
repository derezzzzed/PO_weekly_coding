Salesforce has two different ways to add customizations into the org. Declarative customizations allow for a quick, codeless addition to the org. 
It's best practice to use declarative customizations over programmatic customization because declarative customizations are updated along with any
new versions of Salesforce. Whereas programmatic customizations will likely not be updated along with newer versions therefore making them difficult 
to maintain because it would have to be manually maintained. Also, using declarative customizations allows for many of the testing and security
enforcement of the org to be applied automatically. On the otherhand, Programattic customizations allow for very precise functions that would
otherwise be impossible using normal declarative functions. But again, many of the programttic customizations would require use of security 
keywords into the code because it default runs on the system level where nothing is enforced.
